# Project: Homepage

This is a homepage project built as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum - _Advanced HTML and CSS: Homepage_.

[Live Demo](https://jjjmdev.github.io/homepage/)

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The site adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

- **CSS Grid:** I used CSS Grid to manage the layout and create a consistent design.

- **Custom properties:** I defined colors and values in one place for easy maintenance.

- **Solid HMTL structure:** I used semantic HTML elements and created a clear hierarchy of content.
